## 📌 Introduction

**BOSSS** is a GenAI-powered voice assistant designed specifically for **Grab's driver-partners (DAX)** to provide hands-free, safe, and intelligent support while driving. Developed for **UMHackathon 2025**, BOSSS is tailored to operate in **noisy, real-world driving environments**—enabling drivers to interact via natural speech to get directions, perform tasks like calling or rejecting customers, and much more.

The solution aligns with Grab’s mission of *economic empowerment through AI*, leveraging speech recognition and natural language understanding to automate tasks, reduce distractions, and keep hands on the wheel.

## 💡 How It Works (Full Flow)

1. 🎙 **Driver Speaks**  
2. 🧠 `speech_button_client.py` captures and converts speech to text  
3. 📡 Sends the text to `app.py` → `/classify`  
4. 🤖 DistilBERT predicts the user **intent**  
5. 📡 Sends the intent to `forward_intent_server.py` → `/process`  
6. 🔧 JSON output is returned for downstream processing  
7. 🔊 Response is read aloud using `pyttsx3`
